"""
Entropy sampling on a random subset for computational efficiency.

This module implements a two-stage sampling approach: first randomly selecting
a subset of unlabeled data, then applying entropy-based selection within that
subset. This reduces computational cost when the unlabeled pool is very large.

    Selects high-entropy samples from a random subset of the unlabeled pool.

    This sampler improves efficiency for large unlabeled pools by first
    randomly sampling a subset, then applying entropy-based selection within
    that subset. This two-stage approach reduces the number of model forward
    passes required while still leveraging uncertainty-based acquisition.
